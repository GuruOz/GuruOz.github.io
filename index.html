          <p style="text-align: justify;" >I'm currently <span id="age" ></span> years old. Graduated from University of South Australia on 2020 (COVID-19 year lol) with Bachelors in IT. I specialised in Networking and Cybersecurity. I finished my degree with a 6.91GPA (That's out of 7 in Australia). I definitely don't shy away from putting time and dedication into what I truly enjoy, and I truly enjoy IT. Throughout my Uni, I have demonstrated really good accountability, communications and leadership. I do not shy away from any challenge, responsibility or new technology. <em>and my curiosity hasn't killed me yet, so I guess I'm still looking for new experiences as always! </em>  </p>

            Since young I've had this fascination with technology. Well my dad being an accomplished database admin did help. I guess IT runs in the fam yo. When I was 6-7 years old, my dad bought a Compaq computer. Jeez the amount of hours I sunk into it. I mean, I wasn't like some genius child prodigy who could code in his dream or anything. All I did was just play Commander Keen, Super Worms (I faintly remember my mom enjoying this one as well), multiple pinball games with different skins on and MANY MORE games that I can't remember. But I do remember calling my dad at work and asking him to bring me a game. If I got lucky, he would bring a Floppy-disk with a new game. The 1.44MB size floppy-disk filled with 0s & 1s that made up a Commander Keen game definitely made my week. Funny how a game can be 100GB nowadays and still be absolute trash lol.

            When I was around 10 years old, my parents bought for me an Xbox 360 and boyyyy did it define my teenage life. I spent countless hours grinding Halo 3 lonewolves at 3am without my parents finding out. Ahhh, the dangerous life I was living back then! I guess the gist is that gaming was a big part of my life and it still is. It is was that made me so fascinated with IT.

             Went on to Singapore Poly to persue my Diploma in Computer Engineering. 3 years later, i got my diploma after finishing my enormous FYP project on drones. (Read more about it <a href="#fyp" style="text-decoration: underline;">here</a>). I was really proud of what I did in that project actually. It was mostly a one man show in a four man team. With my other teammates being a no-show or just being totally incapable of coding, it was totally up to me to save our group. I was told that coding a drone to fly by itself was university level of difficulty but that didnt stop us from blindly choosing this project LOL. I singlehandedly engineered a method to code a drone to fly by itself with obstacle avoidance. Granted, it was faaar from perfect or even remotely usable, but the proof of concept was solid and that was enough to impress the poly lecturers. <em>(if somehow my fyp team is reading this, no offence but I meant every word here haha)</em>

            After completing my diploma I was sent off to go through every Singaporean male ritual. 2 years of National service had a significant impact on me. Made new friends and learnt new things. During this period, I found a new liking for networking. Managed to study and pass the Cisco CCENT exam, my first certification. A memorable milestone indeed. I did collect some accolades along the way! <em>(Read more about it <a href="#NS" style="text-decoration: underline;">here</a>)</em>

            After my time in the Army ended, the next major challenge of my life was brewing. I was off to traverse through the oceanic region of earth, in Australia <em>(or "Straya" as the locals calls it)</em>. And yes, everything was <span class="txtUpsideDown">&nbsp; .nwod edispu &nbsp;</span>

            University went as smooth as it could for a foreigner doing 4 intense courses semester after semester. Though I loved every bit of it. I knew being a minority, it would have been easy for me to fade into the background of every class. I did not want that at all. I actively participated in in-class activities as well as outside. I believe (or i would like to think) that I have made a positive impression on everyone I interacted with throughout my time in Uni. Every group project was a challenge (working with humans always is), but I came out with the highest grade possible all the time. All I had to do was just take the lead and ensure we met our criteria. I also loved presenting to the classroom (although I did get pit stains Every. Single. Time). I just enjoyed the process of building a script and the powerpoint slides. Felt like a showman because I tried to add some "mic drop" moments every now and then into the slides. Soon final semester came around and I was faced with my capstone project which was no doubt a mountain of a challenge. My team and I were tasked to hack into iOS and Android phones to research about Social media application <em>(Read more about it <a href="#capstone" style="text-decoration: underline;">here</a>)</em>. And when that was done, I was happy to have graduated with a whopping 6.95GPA. haha, still cant believe I was able to pull that one off. I'm just glad I chose do do what I love!

            I'm now <span id="age2" style="transform: rotateX(180deg); "></span> years old and my love for IT has only grown throughout the years.
